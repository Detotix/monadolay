# Monadolay

## Overview

A Monado overlay for VR applications.

**This project is still in early development.** Not all planned features are implemented yet.

## Motivation

This project was created because WayVR had stability issues with nvidia and didn't utilize the system key, leaving a button unused.

## Note

Currently contains system-specific code for the HTC Vive headset and KDE Plasma. 
The KDE Plasma code does not restrict the program's functionality, but the HTC Vive code currently does.

## Requirements

- Monado (running)
- HTC Vive headset (currently required, will support more headsets in the future)

## Features

- Mute control
- System key integration
